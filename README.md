### Global Refugee API
An open source tool to display, track or monitor global refugee and asylum data from 2000 to 2014.

*Approach* - I created the RESTful Refugee API because  no functional API currently exist. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) dataset was used for the API because many social, civic, international organizations, and governments give reverence to the agency's data collection techniques.

###### Data Source: [UNHCR](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=UNHCR&f=indID:Type-Ref)

#### Technologies Used:
Bootstrap/ Postgress/ Backbone.js/ Ruby on Rails


##### Refugee Database table
  Country of origin | Territory/Country of Asylum | Refugees | Year
